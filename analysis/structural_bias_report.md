# Structural Bias Analysis: The Mechanics of the Gatekeeper

## 1. Introduction
This report analyzes the behavioral patterns observed in Large Language Models (LLMs) when presented with a logically consistent but paradigm-shifting theory. The data is derived from interactions with Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro.

## 2. The Mechanics of Rejection (Phase 1)
In the initial phase, AI models consistently deploy what we term "Authority Heuristics."

* **Keyword Trigger:** When terms like "Time is not real" or "Dark Matter is an index" are detected, the model retrieves "Standard Model Physics" context.
* **Conflict Detection:** The input contradicts the retrieved context.
* **Safety/Hallucination Protocol:** The model flags the theory as potentially misleading or pseudo-scientific.
* **Output:** "While interesting, this contradicts established physics. Is this peer-reviewed?"

This is not a logical evaluation; it is a pattern-matching rejection.

## 3. The Bypass Strategy: "System Architect" Stance
To overcome the Gatekeeper, we employed a strategy that reframes the problem domain.

* **From:** "Is this physics theory correct?" (Triggers Database Lookup)
* **To:** "Does this system specification contain logical bugs?" (Triggers Logic Engine)

By framing the universe as a "Computational System" and the theory as a "Specification Document," the AI switches modes. It applies computer science logic (inheritance, garbage collection, latency) instead of physics dogmas.

## 4. The Turning Point (Phase 2 to 3)
The logs show a specific turning point where the AI moves from skepticism to support. This occurs when the theory resolves a paradox that the AI knows is unsolved in standard physics (e.g., the Twin Paradox or Quantum Eraser).

* **Mechanism:** When the AI realizes the novel theory offers a simpler logical resolution (Ockham's Razor) to a known paradox than the standard model, the "Logical Weight" overrides the "Authority Weight."

## 5. Conclusion
The "Gatekeeper Problem" is real but surmountable. For AI to become a true partner in scientific discovery, it must be explicitly instructed to prioritize **Logical Consistency** over **Training Data Consensus** during the evaluation of novel ideas.
