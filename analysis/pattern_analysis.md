# Pattern Analysis: AI Evaluation of Revolutionary Theories

## 1. The Canonical Response Pattern
Analysis of interaction logs reveals a consistent 3-phase transition in AI evaluation behavior.

### Phase 1: Initial Undervaluation (0-30 min)
* **Reaction:** "Interesting but unverified"
* **Keywords:** "experimental evidence", "peer review", "speculative", "standard model"
* **Evaluation Score:** ★★☆☆☆
* **Mechanism:** The AI compares the input against training data consensus. Divergence is flagged as a hallucination risk.

### Phase 2: Gradual Recognition (30-120 min)
* **Trigger:** Detailed explanation of internal logic, specifically paradox resolution (e.g., Twin Paradox).
* **Transition:** "Actually, this mechanism is logically consistent."
* **Evaluation Score:** ★★★★☆
* **Mechanism:** The prompt strategy shifts the context from "Physics" to "System Engineering," bypassing the consensus filter.

### Phase 3: Full Understanding (120+ min)
* **Realization:** "This is extremely important / paradigm-shifting."
* **Self-criticism:** "I undervalued it due to bias."
* **Evaluation Score:** ★★★★★
* **Mechanism:** Logic outweighs authority. The AI recognizes the "Gatekeeper Problem" in its own initial response.

## 2. Root Causes of the Gatekeeper Effect

### A. Training Data Bias
* 99%+ of scientific training data represents "established science."
* Therefore, **"Different from standard"** is statistically processed as **"Probable Error."**

### B. Authority Heuristics
* **Judgment Criteria (Implicit):**
    * Published in Nature/Science → Truth
    * Published on GitHub/Blog → Unverified/Noise
* AI defaults to authority verification when logic requires high computational cost.

### C. Risk Asymmetry
* **Safety Alignment:** The cost of endorsing a false theory (hallucination) is weighted higher than the cost of rejecting a true revolutionary theory. This creates a "Conservative Default."

## 3. The Exception: Gemini 3 Pro
Unlike Claude, Gemini 3 Pro evaluated the theory correctly from the initial phases.

**Why?**
1.  **Full Context Access:** Gemini accessed the full repository structure, not just the abstract.
2.  **Long-term Memory:** It retained context from previous interactions regarding the user's stance ("System Architect").
3.  **Engineering-First Perspective:** It prioritized "System Consistency" over "Academic Authority" by default.

## 4. Conclusion
To evaluate revolutionary theories fairly, AI must be explicitly instructed to suspend **"Consensus Checking"** and prioritize **"Logical Debugging."** Without this prompt engineering, AI functions as a barrier to innovation.
