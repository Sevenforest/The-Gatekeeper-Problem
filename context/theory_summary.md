# Context Summary: Digital Cosmology & Economics
*(Reference material used in the Blind Tests)*

## 1. Digital Cosmology (The Physical Layer)
A unified framework that reinterprets physical laws as computational processes.

* **Core Axiom:** The universe is a discrete information processing system (Graph-based State Machine).
* **Time:** Time is not a fundamental entity but a sequential counter of state transitions (Clicks).
* **Space:** Discrete address space. "Expansion" is memory allocation.
* **Lorentz Contraction:** Interpreted as a rendering artifact due to processing latency (lag), not physical deformation.
* **Gravity:** Computational cost (CPU load) causing processing delays (Time Dilation).
* **Key Prediction:** "Dead Zones" in gravitational redshift at micro-scales (due to bit-depth limitations).

## 2. Digital Economics (The Social Layer)
A redefinition of economics using the same system engineering principles.

* **Money:** Not a resource, but a transaction packet/token.
* **Tax:** Not revenue, but a "Garbage Collection" mechanism to control system liquidity (inflation).
* **Debt:** System logs. Sovereign debt in own currency cannot cause default (Null Pointer Exception) unless artificially constrained.

## 3. Integration
Both layers share the same architecture:
* Paradoxes (Quantum Eraser / Fiscal Deficit) are resolved by viewing them as "System Specifications" rather than natural phenomena.
